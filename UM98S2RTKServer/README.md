# UM982 RTK Server with TTGO T-Display-S3 (Multi miner)

This project connects a UM980 or UM982 RTK GNSS receiver to a TTGO T-Display/-S3 allowing you to share RTK correction data with up to three networks at one time (Some give mining rewards). The ESP32 will automatically program the UM980/2 so there is no need to mess around with terminals or or the UPrecise software.

All up you it will cost about US$200 to make the station with GNSS receiver, antenna and ESP32 with display. 

If you want to send to more than three casters you can connect a second ESP32 in parallel to the TX port of the UM98x and power both ESP32's at the some time. No need for a second UM98x or expensive splitters.

The display also allow you to see at an instant if the system is connected and sending to all the casters

NOTE : Although the code is able to send data to three RTK casters, if one of the casters fails to receive the message (blocks) the other will be delayed. I'm working on a better option to make non blocking socket calls or daisy chain ESP-S2-Mini's to handle more casters.

## Hardware 

### Components 
 
1. **UM982 with antenna** - Witte Intelligent WTRTK-982 high-precision positioning and orientation module. I got it from AliExpress for about A$220.00 [Not affiliate link. Find your own seller](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007287184287.html)
 
2. **ESP32** With display. ONE of the following

3. **Wires and Protoboard** - Connects the ESP32 to receiver as described below.

### Setup & Installation 

1. **Install VS Code** : Follow [Instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)

2. **Install the PlatformIO IDE** : Download and install the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install).
 
3. **Clone This Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mctainsh/Esp32.git
```

or just copy the files from
```
https://github.com/mctainsh/Esp32/tree/main/UM98RTKServer/UM98RTKServer
```
4. **Enable the TTGO T-Display header** : To use the TTGO T-Display-S3 with the TFT_eSPI library, you need to make the following changes to the User_Setup.h file in the library.

```
	.pio\libdeps\lilygo-t-display\TFT_eSPI\User_Setup_Select.h
	4.1. Comment out the default setup file
		//#include <User_Setup.h>           // Default setup is root library folder
	4.2. Uncomment the TTGO T-Display-S3 setup file
		#include <User_Setups/Setup206_LilyGo_T_Display_S3.h>     // For the LilyGo T-Display S3 based ESP32S3 with ST7789 170 x 320 TFT
	4.3. Add the following line to the start of the file
		#define DISABLE_ALL_LIBRARY_WARNINGS
```

### Configuration 

1. Create the accounts with [Oncony register](https://console.onocoy.com/auth/register/personal), [RtkDirect](https://cloud.rtkdirect.com/) or [RTK2GO](http://rtk2go.com/sample-page/new-reservation/)

2. Don't wire up anything to start with (We can let the smoke out of it later)

3. Upload the program to your ESP32. 

4. Power it up and check display for WIFI connection status.

5. Following instruction at [WifiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager) to connect your ESP32 to your WIFI.

6. Configure the RTK Servers you want to use in the "Configure Wifi" Screen.

7. Wire up the ESP32 to UM98x. Power it fom UM98x (Sometime the ESP32 doesn't output enough beans).

8. Review the status and logs through the web interface (http://x.x.x.x/i)

### Important

The T-Display-S3 will turn off it's display after about 30 seconds. This is OK, just press either button to turn it on again.

### Display

The display has several screens you can toggle through them by pressing one of the buttons.

The top line of the display shows the following

## TODO

1. Write instructions to install without compiling with PlatformIO (Using ESP32 Upload tool)

2. Make http sends in non-blocking to prevent one NTRIP server upsetting the others

3. Rework the TTGO T-Display code to make the display nicer (Currently optimized for larger S3)

4. Put each NTRIP server details on its own page

5. Make better looking STL

6. Build one using ESP32-S3 Mini board. Won't have display but will be very compact
